# Dataset for Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis

Welcome to the core of our project — the **Dataset** folder. This is where it all begins! The data is the foundation of the analysis, machine learning models, and insights you’ll explore in this project. Let's dive into the details of what you'll find here:

### **Key File:**
- **airline_passenger_satisfaction_data.csv**: This CSV file contains a rich dataset with information on airline passenger demographics, flight details, satisfaction levels, and service ratings. Each row represents a passenger’s journey, and the columns contain valuable attributes like customer type, age, flight distance, satisfaction, and more.

You can explore the dataset directly [here](https://github.com/Vishnugnath/Airline-passenger-satisfaction-analysis-project/tree/main/dataset).

### **Dataset Details:**
The dataset encompasses a variety of features related to airline passengers' experiences. These include:
- **Customer Type**: Whether the passenger is a frequent or first-time customer.
- **Age**: The age of the passenger.
- **Gender**: Gender of the passenger.
- **Flight Distance**: The distance traveled on the flight.
- **Class**: The travel class (e.g., Business, Economy).
- **Satisfaction**: Whether the passenger is satisfied with their experience (Satisfaction Level).
- **Service Ratings**: Ratings given to different service categories like seat comfort, in-flight entertainment, and food quality.

This data plays a pivotal role in identifying factors influencing passenger satisfaction and is used in all subsequent steps, from cleaning to feature engineering and machine learning model training.

### **Data Quality and Preprocessing:**
You will notice that this raw dataset contains some inconsistencies, missing values, and categorical variables that need to be handled before any useful analysis can be performed. We have taken care of these issues in later stages of the project.
