# Dataset After Feature Engineering

Once the raw data has been cleaned and processed, we create the **cleaned and feature-engineered dataset**. This refined dataset serves as the input for training machine learning models and makes it possible to get high-quality predictions.

### **Key File:**
- **airline_passenger_satisfaction_cleaned_data.csv**: This file contains the dataset after data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering. It is used for training and testing the machine learning models.

You can find the cleaned dataset [here](https://github.com/Vishnugnath/Airline-passenger-satisfaction-analysis-project/tree/main/dataset%20after%20feature%20engineering).

### **Features After Engineering:**
- **Encoded Categorical Variables**: Gender, Class, and Satisfaction have been converted into numerical values.
- **Transformed Features**: Flight distance has been categorized into short, medium, and long flights for easier interpretation.
- **Newly Derived Features**: For example, customer loyalty, satisfaction trends, and age groupings have been introduced to improve model accuracy.
- **Handling Missing Values**: Any gaps in the data have been filled with appropriate imputation techniques, ensuring that the dataset is complete and ready for modeling.

### **Why Feature Engineering?**
Feature engineering is a critical step in improving model performance. By creating relevant features and transforming raw data, we provide machine learning algorithms with better inputs that result in more accurate predictions.
