# SQL Queries for Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis

This folder contains a set of **SQL queries** that facilitate detailed exploration and analysis of the dataset. By executing these queries on a relational database, we gain insights into customer behavior, satisfaction levels, and trends across various attributes.

### **Key File:**
- **airline_project_sql.sql**: This file includes a variety of SQL queries designed to answer critical questions from the dataset. The queries provide powerful filtering and aggregation techniques that allow us to uncover relationships between customer demographics and satisfaction levels.

You can find the SQL file [here](https://github.com/Vishnugnath/Airline-passenger-satisfaction-analysis-project/tree/main/sql).

### **SQL Query Highlights:**
- **Basic Selection and Filtering**: Extract passengers based on their gender, age, satisfaction levels, etc.
- **Aggregation and Grouping**: Calculate average flight distances, and count the number of passengers in each satisfaction group.
- **Joins**: Compare satisfaction between customers of the same age group and other demographic features.
- **Window Functions**: Rank customers based on their flight distance and calculate averages over a window of records.
- **Subqueries and Advanced Filtering**: Identify passengers who gave the maximum satisfaction rating or those who flew longer distances.

These queries are executed to uncover valuable patterns and correlations in the dataset, which later guide our feature engineering and model selection in the notebook.
