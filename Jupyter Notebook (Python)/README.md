# Jupyter Notebook for Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis

Welcome to the **Jupyter Notebook (Python)** folder, where the magic happens! In this notebook, the raw data is transformed into actionable insights using Python. The analysis includes a series of critical steps like data cleaning, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling.

### **Key File:**
- **Airline passenger satisfaction project.ipynb**: This is the heart of the project. It contains:
  - **Data Preprocessing**: We clean the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and transforming data for machine learning.
  - **Feature Engineering**: We create new features from the existing ones, like grouping customers based on satisfaction levels or classifying passengers into various satisfaction categories.
  - **Machine Learning Models**: Various models (Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, SVM, and Random Forest) are applied to the data. Each model is trained, evaluated, and compared to identify the best one for predicting passenger satisfaction.
  - **Model Evaluation**: After training the models, their accuracy is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### **Steps in the Notebook:**
- **Data Cleaning**: Remove outliers, handle missing data, and filter out any irrelevant records.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform statistical analysis to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights within the dataset.
- **Model Building**: Train multiple machine learning models to predict customer satisfaction.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to find the optimal hyperparameters for better model performance.
- **Evaluation**: Test the models on unseen data and measure their effectiveness in predicting customer satisfaction.

### **Libraries Used:**
The notebook makes use of the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
